# Anonymous-Mailbox

Everyday, we all need a "safe" space to share our thoughts, make confessions or spread funny vibes. 

Confessions can be a lot of things:
- your "feelings" to someone else you have crush in the school
- your "thoughts" on your new roommate in student dorm
- your roast to someone (in funny way ofc)

Or are you facing a difficult situation in school and want advice from everyone? This is the place. 

We all are here to listen, react and share mutual feelings without judgement.
